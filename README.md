# Enhanced Traffic Simulator

Enhanced Traffic Simulator is a modular, extensible traffic simulation project designed to model and visualize vehicle flow and traffic behavior under realistic scenarios. It supports configurable road networks, multiple vehicle types and driving behaviors, traffic signals, and data collection for experiments and analysis.
